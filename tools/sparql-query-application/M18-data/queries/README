Practice Queries from LDC2019E07 (AIDA Phase 1 Evaluation Practice Topic Annotations)
(Generated on 6/17/2019)

This package contains queries generated from prevailing theories found
in LDC2019E07_AIDA_Phase_1_Evaluation_Practice_Topic_Annotations_V6.0.
The entry point descriptors for TA2 queries are KB IDs from the
partial reference KB in LDC2019E44 (AIDA Phase 1 Practice Topics
Reference Knowledge Base) and therefore specify "LDC2019E44" as the
prefix for the KB ID.

TA1 and TA2 graph queries are generated using the event/relation types
at the level of granularity in the prevailing theories.  In addition,
if a query at the subsubtype level has a role that is defined for the
subtype level as well as all of its subsubtypes, an additional query
is generated at the subtype level. For example, given
Conflict.Attack.FirearmAttack_Attacker in a prevailing theory, we also
automatically generate a query for Conflict.Attack_Attacker; but given
Government.Agreements.AcceptAgreementContractCeasefire_Participant in
a prevailing theory, we do not automatically generate a query for
Government.Agreements_Participant because the "Participant" role is
not defined for Government.Agreements.ViolateAgreement.

Following is the number of queries generated per query type:

  TA1_class   52
  TA1_graph   100
  TA2_graph   118
  TA2_zerohop 31

N.B.: The TA2 queries have been generated even if the link target for
the object is an entity that doesn't have a name. For evaluation, NIST
will use only those objects whose link target is a named entity with
type PER, ORG, GPE, FAC, LOC, WEA, VEH, or LAW.
